### 2026-04-11 — Sudar: brand, personalization v2, trust pack, governance, learner UX

**Continuing this work (operators & agents)**  
- **Database**: Apply `supabase/migrations/20260410000000_personalization_v2.sql` to the shared Supabase project (consent column, `personalization_overlays` on enrollments, `learner_groups` / `learner_group_members`). Then align Prisma: `byteos-studio` — `npx prisma db pull` or `db push` as you normally do for this repo.  
- **Policy & product docs**: Brand and messaging live under `docs/brand/`; security / procurement context under `docs/trust/` (indexed in `docs/trust/README.md`). Studio **Governance** (`/governance`) links learners to the trust pack.  
- **Code map**: Learn personalization gates — `byteos-learn/src/lib/personalization/eligibility.ts`, module overlays API — `byteos-learn/src/app/api/ai/module-personalize/route.ts`, consent — `byteos-learn/src/app/api/learner/ai-consent/route.ts`. Studio org AI compliance + course personalization live in org/course settings and APIs (`byteos-studio/src/app/api/org/settings/route.ts`, course editor). Learner groups API — `byteos-studio/src/app/api/org/learner-groups/`. Mascot system — `byteos-learn/src/lib/mascot/*`, `byteos-learn/src/components/mascot/*`.  
- **Windows / Studio dev**: Prefer `npm run dev` from `byteos-studio` (uses `scripts/run-next.mjs`) so Next resolves correctly; optional `NEXT_FORCE_PROJECT_DIST=1` if you want `.next` inside the app folder. See `byteos-studio/.env.example`.  
- **Shipped feature summary**: [docs/SHIPPED_FEATURES.md](docs/SHIPPED_FEATURES.md) (April 2026 sections). Roadmap text: [docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md](docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md) §2.

**What shipped**  
- **Brand & UI**: Sudar logo components and static marks in Learn and Studio (`SudarLogo.tsx`, `public/sudar-logo.svg`, `public/sudar-logo-mark.svg`); logo assets under `assets/sudar logo/`. Learn theme/globals and Tailwind tokens refined for consistent Sudar visual language.  
- **Mascot (Learn)**: Neutral mascot SVGs in `byteos-learn/public/mascots/`; `MascotAvatar`, `MascotJourneyCard`, `MascotModeBadge`; engine/personas/rollout/tracking under `byteos-learn/src/lib/mascot/`; types in `src/types/mascot.ts`.  
- **Personalization v2**: Opt-in **per-module AI overlays** (`role_explain`, `brief_3min`) stored on `enrollments.personalization_overlays` without changing canonical `modules.content`. Eligibility respects `courses.settings.personalization`, `courses.is_adaptive`, and `organisations.settings.ai_compliance`; learner consent via `learner_profiles.generative_ai_consent_at` and `/api/learner/ai-consent`. Daily usage cap via `module_personalize` in usage limits. Plain-text extraction helper: `byteos-learn/src/lib/learn/modulePlainText.ts`.  
- **Studio**: **Governance** dashboard page; **Compliance** page cross-links; course detail/settings expanded for personalization and org policies; **learner groups** REST API (`/api/org/learner-groups`); Prisma/schema and `database` types updated; agent chat and platform knowledge touch-ups; `fetch-with-deadline` utility; **sensitive input guard** shared pattern with Learn. Middleware and `next.config.mjs` updates; dev scripts `scripts/run-next.mjs`, `scripts/rm-next-cache.mjs`.  
- **Learn (learner experience)**: **Global search** route (`/search`); course viewer, onboarding, paths, settings (including AI consent UI), TopNav, Floating Sudar Chat, enroll-bridge and path-enrollments improvements; tutor and ALP query routes hardened; **sensitive input guard** for tutor-facing inputs.  
- **Docs**: Full **brand** pack (`docs/brand/` — strategy, guidelines, tokens, mascot specs, rollout checklist, deck assets). **Trust** pack (`docs/trust/` — posture, data flows, subprocessors, AI system register, threat model, operations). Root **README**, **ECOSYSTEM**, **AGENTS**, **GITHUB_SETUP**, marketing/pitch decks aligned with Sudar positioning.

### 2026-04-07 — SudarVid overhaul: loader UX, timeline editor, media generation pipeline
- **SudarVid frontend**: Refined UI/UX in `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/assets/main.css`, and `frontend/assets/main.js` with improved timeline editing flow and richer controls for creator-side video building.
- **Playback and loader experience**: Updated `static/js/sudarvid.js`, added dedicated loader assets (`loader.html`, `sudar_loading_v3.html`), and intro/outro template support (`sudarvid-intro-outro.html`).
- **Generation pipeline**: Expanded backend logic across `sudarvid/core.py`, `sudarvid/server.py`, `sudarvid/media.py`, `sudarvid/content_planner.py`, and `sudarvid/image_gen.py` for stronger planning/media orchestration and model handling (`sudarvid/image_models.py`).
- **Themes and templates**: Enhanced render templates (`templates/base.html.j2`) and theme/type wiring (`sudarvid/themes.py`, `sudarvid/types.py`) for higher quality output composition.
- **Config/docs**: Updated `sudar_vid` README, `.env.example`, and dependency set in `requirements.txt` to match the refreshed workflow.

### 2026-03-18 — Vercel builds: login/signup Suspense; Learn UX; marketing site; docs
- **Next.js 15 / Vercel**: Learn and Studio `/login` and `/signup` now use a **Server Component page** + **client `*Client.tsx`** wrapped in `<Suspense>` so `useSearchParams()` no longer fails static generation on Vercel.
- **Learn**: Signup split to match login; removed temporary debug ingest calls from tutor API and chat UI.
- **Learn UX**: Dashboard/progress loading states, greeting/top-nav tweaks, course viewer and modality cards refinements; flashcards API touch-up.
- **teachwithsudar**: Marketing Next.js site (Teach with Sudar) added under repo root.
- **Docs & audit**: LAMP draft, research paper/bib updates; Learn audit notes in `audit/Learn/`.

### 2026-03-17 — Security hardening: IDOR fixes, JWT validation, RLS, rate limits, CSP, logging
- **Authorization & IDOR**: Hardened ALP endpoints to enforce org scope; Intelligence now validates Supabase JWT (subject must match learner_id/user_id) and supports an optional server-to-server secret for ALP proxy calls.
- **Supabase RLS**: Added migrations to enable RLS + ownership policies on learner-scoped tables (learner_profiles, learning_events, ai_interactions, enrollments, certifications) and RAG `content_chunks`.
- **AI cost abuse protection**: Added `usage_limits` (per-user/day) and an atomic increment RPC; Learn now enforces daily limits for tutor and next-action requests. Intelligence adds per-IP rate limiting for tutor and next-action.
- **Input validation & prompt injection**: Tutor message length capped (2000 chars) and basic prompt-override line filtering; Intelligence adds Pydantic validators for tutor inputs.
- **Deployment hardening**: CSP headers added in both Next.js apps; Intelligence disables Swagger/ReDoc in production; `.env` added to Learn .gitignore.
- **Logging**: Added structured JSON logging for auth events, AI provider failures, and FastAPI 4xx/5xx responses (no JWT/PII).

## What we've built (phase-wise)

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
- Supabase schema (profiles, organisations, courses, modules, enrollments, learning_events, ai_interactions, learner_profiles, learning_paths, certifications).
- Shared auth (Supabase Auth) across Studio and Learn.
- ByteOS Studio scaffold (Next.js 14): dashboard, courses CRUD, org/workspace.
- ByteOS Learn scaffold (Next.js 14): dashboard, course catalog, enrollments.
- Environment contracts and RLS policies.

### Phase 2 — Integration ✅
- Course publish: Studio publishes to Supabase; Learn reads and displays published courses.
- Enrollments and learning_events (module start/complete, quiz attempts, duration).
- Progress calculation and enrollment status (not_started, in_progress, completed).
- End-to-end flow: author → publish → enroll → learn → track.

### Phase 3 — Learner experience ✅
- **Personalised dashboard**: Streak, total learning time, engagement %, courses completed, “Sudar recommends” (next best action). DashboardSidebar, TopNav, ActivityChart, ProgressPieChart, PathNodeGraph. CourseThemeProvider and learning personas (themed experience per course).
- **Course viewer**: Markdown rendering, module navigation, progress auto-save, quizzes with immediate feedback. SCORM delivery: proxy for SCORM package assets from Supabase Storage (course-media) with correct MIME types for iframe playback.
- **AI tutor "Sudar"**: RAG over course content (content_chunks + pgvector 1024, ingest API, embed/retrieve/cache). Floating Sudar Chat (global), startup questions, paste context. Longitudinal memory (ai_interactions + ai_tutor_context), contextual “Explain this” from text selection. Structured tutor responses (blocks/actions: enroll, continue, review). Validate-memory quick preferences (response length, modality). Tutor workflow API (summarize, extract_terms). Outcome logging (tutor_action_taken) for learning from suggestions. My Memory page (view/edit what Sudar knows). Memory insights builder and InsightsCarousel.
- **Onboarding assessment**: Short intake flow to bootstrap learner profile (goals, background, style).
- **Learning paths**: Enroll in paths, personalised sequence for adaptive paths, path progress and unlock rules (complete previous first).
- **Certifications**: Auto-issued on path completion, shareable public verification link, Print/Save as PDF.
- **Progress page**: Single view for courses, paths, and certificates.
- **Upcoming deadlines** and **Required by your organisation** on dashboard.
- **Auth**: Change password flow when require_password_change is set (e.g. after admin reset).

### Phase 4 — Intelligence ✅
- **Next best action**: Scores unenrolled courses from learner profile, AI-generated reason, stored in learner_profiles.
- **Struggle detection**: Quiz wrong answers feed into ai_tutor_context.struggles_with; used for path ordering and tutor context.
- **Adaptive path ordering**: Optional courses in a path reordered per learner (Sudar surfaces gaps, deprioritises known concepts).
- **Personalised welcome**: On enrollment in adaptive courses, AI-generated welcome that connects prior learning to the new course.
- **Studio analytics**: Org-level completions, quiz scores, top struggle topics; **Compliance** view (overdue / at-risk / on-track).
- **Path assignment**: Assign path to learners from Studio, optional due date, “Assigned learners” table.

### Phase 5 — Scale (in progress)
- **Done**: Path assignment + due dates, compliance view, certificate print, upcoming deadlines, required paths; compliance **email reminders** (Studio cron — see SHIPPED_FEATURES.md).
- **Implemented**: Flashcards modality (Learn: FlashcardsCard, generate-flashcards API); document-to-course (Studio: generate-from-document API for PDF/DOCX/URL); SCORM 1.2 import (Studio: import-scorm API). RAG in Learn (content_chunks, ingest, tutor search); Floating Sudar Chat (global); tutor workflows (summarize/extract_terms); outcome logging; validate-memory quick preferences; memory insights carousel; SCORM delivery proxy (Learn); change-password flow. **Personalization v2** (overlays, consent, learner groups), Sudar **brand/mascot** surfaces, **trust** docs + Studio Governance (2026-04-11 — see Latest above).
- **Upcoming**: SudarPlay / SudarFeed / SudarMind wiring, white-label, SSO/HRIS; production hardening of personalization policies.
